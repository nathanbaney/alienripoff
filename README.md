/* HINDSIGHT OVERVIEW / RESUME INFORMATION

This was a case of an over-eager project with more focus on theoretical concepts (procedural generation of cohesive, compelling 2d "dungeons")
losing sight of actual implementation. At some point, a combination of too much school work and key realizations made me stop the project, for
now at least. The key realization was that a procedurally generated map layout for something like a metroidvania game just simply won't be
as compelling as a hand-crafted one, unless the procedural generation makes heavy use of pre-fabricated "chunks", but at that point you might
as well just hand-craft the entire map layout. Interesting concept though, as far as gameplay goes; might need to revisit.
