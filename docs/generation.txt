have predetermined nodes, rule matrix to determine what can connect to what, and generate a rough layout of the whole map.
then use some more fine-grain generation (wfc?) to generate the actual internal layouts. 

basically, many passes of wfc, each adding a layer of detail.

layers:
1. entire station, with substation positions and bridges connecting them
2. rough intra-substation generation, designating rough sectors of various predetermined types. for instance, habitation could have housing sectors, entertainment, idk
3. per-sector generation, actually making rooms of various types
